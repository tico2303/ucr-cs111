\begin{problem}
Determine whether the two graphs below are planar or not.
To show planarity, give a planar embedding.
To show that a graph is not planar, use Kuratowski's theorem.

\begin{problem}
	You are given two bipartite graphs $G$ and $H$ below. For each
	graph determine whether it has a perfect matching.
	Justify your answer, either by 
	listing the edges that are in the matching or using
	Hall's Theorem to show that the graph does not have a
	perfect matching.

\paragraph{Submission.}
To submit the homework, you need to upload the pdf file into ilearn by {\hwduedate},
and turn-in a paper copy in class.
Pictures should be 
imported into {\LaTeX} in pdf (see the source file to see
how to do that). You can draw them in any drawing
software and export in pdf, or draw by hand and scan.
